                        a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is

                        fast food restaurants. The dish is traditionally served with mashed potatoes, gravy, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, corn or biscuits.<br>

                        Lasagne is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian 
                        dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which 
                        may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. 
                        The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other 
                        ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.<br>

                        fish like salmon in the salmon burger, but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger.<br>

                        Kebabs consist of cut up or ground meat, sometimes with vegetables, and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe.
                         Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are baked in a pan in an oven or prepared as a stew 
                         such as tas kebab. The traditional meat for kebabs is most often mutton or lamb, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, 
                         fish, or more rarely due to religious prohibitions, pork.<br>

                        Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other 
                        shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to 
                        yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.<br>

                        vegetables, and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety. They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa,
